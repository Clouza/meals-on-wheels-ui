Meals on Wheels is a non-commercial project related to food

## Project Overview

The developers of a leading enterprise solution   provider namely “Unity One Solutions” were tasked to develop a project called “Meals on Wheels”. The developers’ manager Mr. David assigned the developers to design the software and they are required to submit a proposal, a development plan, and a functional application.

The organization who requested for the task was “MerryMeal”. It is a charitable organization that prepares and delivers a hot noon meal to qualified adults living at home who are unable to cook for themselves or maintain their nutritional status due to age, disease, or disability. The service will be available Monday through Friday. Frozen meals will be provided to members who are not within a 10-kilometer radius of their outsourced kitchens and support over the weekend. It has partnered with several food service providers across the country to provide the quickest delivery possible.
